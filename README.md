Despite the past competition between Uber and Yellow Taxi Companies, Uber recently announced that they will partner with Yello Taxi Companies to provide better service for passengers in NYC. In this project, we work on hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015 to explore how their business went during this time period.
